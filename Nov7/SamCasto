You will need to create a file that is named your username and paste your answers in it.
After you have completed the questions, submit a pull request in this same repository.

1) Why is there such a "learning curve" when learning a traditional programming

because it is like learning a new language and you have to learn how it all works

2) What is learning to program ultimately about?
learning to think logically and to approach new problems methodically

3) How does Scratch "lower the bar" to programming?
allows people to focus on the problem rather than the syntax

4) What is a statement in a programming language?

5) What is a Boolean expression?

a local variable is for one sprite and global is for all sprites

9) What is a Boolean variable?
a variable that has only two response, normally true/false

10) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered threads?
the brown blocks which are under the event tab and start with when

11) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered event handlers?
the blocks that start with when and start when another script runs and activates them

12) How many sprites are implemented in Oscartime?
9

13) How many threads are used to display the Oscartime game instructions?
1

14) How many threads are used by Oscartime's Oscar sprite?
3

15) What programming constructs does Scratch NOT support?
